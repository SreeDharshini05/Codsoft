                About the Kalpana Chawla  
            </h1>  
<p>  




<br><br>☛ Kalpana Chawla was on 17 March 1962 in Punjabi Hindu family in Karnal Haryana.She completed her schoolingfrom Tagore Baal Niketan Senior Secondary School,Karnal.Growing up went to local flying clubs and watched planes with her father.<br><br>

☛ After graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College,India.In 1982 Chaewla moved to United States and in 1984,She graduated with Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from University of Texas at Arlington and went to earn second Master's in 1986 and a PhD in Aerospace Engineering in 1988 from University of Colorado Boulder.<br><br>

☛ In 1988,Chawla joined NASA's Ames Research Centre,where she initially conduted computational fluid dynamics research on vertical and/or short take-off and landing (V/STOL) concept.<br><br>

☛ Chawla held a certified Flight Instructor rating for airplanes,gliders and commercial Piolet licenses for single and multi-engine airplanes,seaplanes and gliders.<br><br>

☛ After becoming a naturalized U.S citizen in April 1991,she applied for tge NASA Astronaut Corps.Chawla joined in March 1995 and selected for her first flight in 1977.<br><br>

☛ Her first's space mission began on 19 November 1997,as part of the six-0aatronaut crew that flew the Space Shuttle Columbia flight STS-87.<br><br>

☛ Kalpana Chawla was an Indian born American astronaut and aerospace engineer who was the first woman of India to fly space. She flew on spacew shuttle Columbia in the year 1977 as a mission specialist and primary robot arm operator.<br><br>

☛ Chawla had travelled 10.67 million km, as many as 252 times around Earth,Chawla travelled 10.4/6.5 milion miles in 252 orbits of the Earth,logging more than 376 hours(15 days and 16 hours) in space.<br><br>

☛ During STS-87,she was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Takao Doi to capture the satellite.A five-month NASA investigation exonerated Chawla by identifying errors in software interfaces and the defined procedures of the flight crew and ground control.<br><br>

☛ After the completion of STS-87 post-flight activities,Chawla was assigned to technical positions in the astronaut office to wggork on the space station.<br><br>

☛ In 2000,Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107.This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems such as the July 2002 discovery of cracks in the shuttle engine flow liners.<br><br>

☛ On 16 January 2003,Chawla finally returned to space aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on the illfated STS-107 mission.The crew performed neraly 80 experiments studying Earth and space science,advanced technology development,and astronaut health and safety.<br><br>

☛ When Columbia re-entered the atmosphere of Earth on 1 February 2003, the damage allowed hot atmospheric gases to penetrate and destroy the internal wing structure, which caused the spacecraft to become unstable and break apart over Texas.Chawla died along with the other six crew members.After the disaster, Space Shuttle flight operations were suspended for more than two years, similar to the aftermath of the Challenger disaster. Construction of the International Space Station (ISS) was put on hold; the station relied entirely on the Russian Roscosmos State Corporation for resupply for 29 months until Shuttle flights resumed with STS-114 and 45 months for crew rotation.<br><br>
